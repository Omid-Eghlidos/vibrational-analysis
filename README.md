# Vibrational Analysis of Structures

This repository contains a MATLAB program for performing vibrational analysis of structures.

## Requirements

MATLAB 2022 or later versions with the following toolbox:

* Parallel pool toolbox, i.e. "gcp" toolbox

## Dependencies

This program contains the following folders for running properly.

### Inputs folder

This folder contains the following files:

1) A picture of a finite elements meshed structure using NASTRAN
2) NASTRAN output4 format file for stiffness matrix ("K.dat")
3) NASTRAN output4 format file for mass matrix ("M.dat")
4) A MATLAB data file containing parameters for performing the analysis ("parameters.mat")

### Library folder

This folder contains the classes and functions used for performing the analysis, including the followings:

1) nastranOutputReader (function) -> Read the output4 format files generated by NASTRAN.
2) FiniteElementsModel.m (class) -> Generate FE model of the structure.
3) ModalExpansionMethod.m (class) -> Performs vibrational analysis of the structure's FE model using modal expansion method.
4) ImpedanceMatrixMethod.m (class) -> Performs vibrational analysis of the structure's FE model using impedance matrix method.
5) Plotting.m (class) -> Plot the results of each method and their comparisons, and generates 3D animation of structure's vibration modes.
6) getObjectInstances.m (function) -> Creates a persistent instance of each of the classes and save it for the next program run, if needed, to save time by preventing repeated initialization.

### Results folder

This folder contains all the generated results by the code including a comparison between some of the results obtained by modal expansion method and impedance matrix method for the same set of excitation frequencies in the root and more results obtained for each method in separate folders of "Modal" and "Impedance".

## Deployment

Adjust number of low modes, number of excitation frequencies, and modes to be plotted in the "main.m" and then run it.
